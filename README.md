Objectives

In this activity you will be creating an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

The application will take in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

As a bonus: The application will additionally track these product sales across departments and provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
